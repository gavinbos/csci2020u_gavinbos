#How To Run This Application
This application is the coding portion of the CSCI2020U midterm.

##Running
In order to run the program, you must open the project within a compatible IDE
that is able to run and compile JavaFX. IntelliJ is definitely the most popular IDE
that smoothly integrates with JavaFX, however feel free to use the IDE of your
choice, as long as it is configured for JavaFX. After opening the project in a 
compatible IDE, navigate to the 'main' method within the Midterm class, then run 
the main method. Doing so should generate a UI window for the application.

##Usage
The UI application contains multiple windows you can navigate to and from using
buttons. The first contains a short animation of a circle, the second contains
2D graphics of my initials GB, the third contains an about section
describing the app and myself.
